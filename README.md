# CS50x-Finance

## Introduction
This is one of the assignments provided in CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science.

The goal of the exercise is to:

* Implement a website that allows users to "buy" and "sell" stock with the following functions:
* Complete the implementation of a registration system, enabling users to register for an account.
* Complete the implementation of a quote feature, allowing users to look up the current price of a stock.
* Complete the implementation of a buying system, enabling users to buy stocks.
* Complete the implementation of an index page to display an HTML table summarizing which stocks the logged-in user owns, how many shares, the current price of each stock, and the total value of each holding (i.e., shares times price). Also display the user's current cash balance and a grand total (i.e., the total value of stocks plus cash).
* Complete the implementation of a selling system to allow users to sell shares of stocks they own.
* Complete the implementation of a history page that displays an HTML table summarizing all of a userâ€™s transactions, showing each buy and sell action.

In addition to the required functions, I added some extra features to the website:

* Allow users to change their password.
* Allow users to add more cash to their account.
